# Simulink-Control-of-Parrot-Mini-Drone

Implemented image processing system and path following system for Parrot Mini drone using a lightweight erosion-based pure pursuit algorithm. 

Control system is based on PID controller and simulated by Simulink.

Successfully transferred what achieves in simultion mode to real world. Fulfuilled tasks: take off, object detection, straight path following, curve path following.
